Vegetarian courgette carbonara
Ingredients
100-120g fresh courgette, cubed
4 egg yolks*
175ml single cream
85g vegetarian Italian hard cheese (plus extra to serve)
Black pepper, to taste
1tsp extra virgin olive oil
400g fresh spaghetti, linguine or tagliatelle
*Chef's tip: When separating your egg yolks, try to use cold eggs. Colder eggs are easier to separate.
Instructions
Add your egg yolks to a bowl, along with the cream, freshly grated vegetarian hard cheese and a generous amount of fresh black pepper. whisk these ingredients until well combined and set to one side. 
In a pan over medium heat, add a splash of olive oil. Once hot, add your cubed courgette, and gently fry for around 5 minutes, until softened and slightly browned. Once cooked, remove your courgette from the pan. Remove any excess moisture by gently patting the courgette with some kitchen paper. 
Bring a large saucepan of generously salted water to a rolling boil, before adding your chosen fresh pasta. Cook for between 3-6 minutes, depending on your pasta type, or until al dente (taste a piece before removing from the cooking water).
Once cooked, strain your pasta, ensuring to reserve a splash of the starchy cooking water. 
Add your courgette back to the large frying pan, and heat the mixture back up if cold (courgette doesn't retain its heat). Add your pasta to the pan, and immediately remove the mixture from the heat. Add your egg mixture, and toss the mixture vigorously, so the sauce does not settle on the base of the pan. Move the sauce continuously, to ensure the mixture does not curdle - the residual heat from the pan should heat the sauce, without fully cooking the eggs. Add the pasta water adjusting as necessary to obtain a silky sauce that completely coats your pasta. 
Once fully coated, plate your pasta, and garnish with a generous helping of vegetarian hard cheese. Buon appetito
