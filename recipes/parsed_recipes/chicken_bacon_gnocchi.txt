Chicken bacon gnocchi
Ingredients
6 slices bacon cut into small pieces
2 medium chicken breasts cut into bite-size pieces
1 large clove garlic minced
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy/whipping cream
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 pound uncooked potato gnocchi
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
Salt & pepper to taste
Instructions
In a deep skillet, over medium-high heat, fry the bacon until itâ€™s crispy (about 10 mins.). I use kitchen shears to make cutting the bacon up quick & hassle-free.
Once the bacon is done, take it out of the pan, and leave about a tablespoon of the bacon fat in the pan. Discard the rest of the fat or save it for another use.
Add the chicken to the pan and cook it for 2-3 minutes, stirring often, or until the chicken turns white on the outside. If the chicken is sticking when you try to stir it, give it a little more time to release naturally.
Add the garlic to the pan and give it a good stir.
Reduce the heat to medium and then add the chicken broth, cream, Italian seasoning, gnocchi, and bacon back into the pan (stir well). Cover the pan and cook for 4 minutes.
Continue cooking the gnocchi, uncovered, for a few more minutes until the sauce reduces/thickens to your liking (stir every so often). 
Stir in the parmesan cheese and season with salt & pepper as needed. Serve immediately.
