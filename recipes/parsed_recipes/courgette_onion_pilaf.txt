Courgette and caramlised onion Pilaf
Ingredients
300g basmati rice
50g butter
2 onions, finely sliced
2 tsp black mustard seeds
2 tsp cumin seeds
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
A thumb-sized piece of ginger, finely chopped
1 courgette, sliced
2 ripe tomatoes, diced
1 cinnamon stick, broken in half
2 cardamom pods
2 strips of lemon zest
600ml chicken stock
A handful of mint leaves, shredded
A handful of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
Raita, to serve (optional)

Instructions
Tip the rice into a bowl, fill with cold water and move the grains around until the water is very cloudy. Gently tip the water out, refill and repeat until the water is clear. Drain really well.
Melt the butter in a large lidded pan or casserole over a medium-high heat and cook the onions with a large pinch of salt for 20 minutes, stirring regularly, until really caramelised. 
Scoop out 1/3 into a small bowl.
Add the seeds and cook for a minute until smelling toasty. 
Tip in the garlic, ginger and courgette, and cook for a few minutes until starting to soften, then add the tomatoes, spices, lemon zest and rice, and mix really well, until all the grains of rice are coated.
Pour in the stock, add lots of seasoning and bring to the boil for 1 minute, then reduce to a low heat. 
Put some foil over the pan with the lid on top and cook gently for 10 minutes without removing the lid. 
Remove from the heat and leave to steam with the lid still on for 10 minutes.
Gently fork through the mint and parsley, trying not to break the grains, top with the remaining onions, then serve with raita, if you like.
