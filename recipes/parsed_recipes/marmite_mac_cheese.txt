Instructions
Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7
Boil a full kettle
Melt 15g butter in a pan over a medium heat
Once melted, add 15g flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms. 
Gradually whisk 300ml milk into the roux, a little at a time, and cook for 5-8 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains.
Add the double cream, Dijon mustard and half the Marmite (save the rest for later!).
Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, stir it all together and remove the pan from the heat. 
Meanwhile, add the macaroni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat.
Cook the macaroni for 7-8 min or until cooked with a slight bite.
Whilst the macaroni is cooking, grate the cheddar cheese.
In a bowl combine the grated Italian hard cheese with the panko breadcrumbs – these are your cheesy breadcrumbs.
In a separate bowl combine the remaining Marmite with 1 tbsp [2 tbsp] boiled water – this is your Marmite drizzle. Tip: Whisk it together until fully combined!
Once the macaroni is cooked, return the Marmite béchamel sauce to a medium-high heat.
Add the drained macaroni with the grated cheddar and give everything a good mix up until the cheese has melted.
Transfer the mixture to an oven-proof dish.
Top with the cheesy breadcrumbs and Marmite drizzle.
Drizzle generously with olive oil and put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden and bubbling – this is your Marmite mac 'n' cheese.
Once the Marmite mac 'n' cheese has been in the oven for 10 min, reboil a kettle.
Add the Tenderstem broccoli and green beans to a pot with a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of boiled water.
Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a slight bite.
Once done, drain, return to the pot and keep covered until serving.
Remove the Marmite mac 'n' cheese from the oven and leave to stand for 5 min.
Serve the Marmite mac 'n' cheese with the cooked greens to the side.
Enjoy!
