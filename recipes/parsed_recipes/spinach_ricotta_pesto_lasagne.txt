190g jar pesto
2 heaped tbsp pinenuts

Instructions
STEP 1Melt the butter in a large pan, then stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes. Whisk in the milk gradually, one splash at a time, to make a smooth sauce. Bring to a gentle bubble while still stirring, then cook for a couple of minutes until thickened.STEP 2Turn off the heat and whisk in the ricotta until smooth, followed by half of the parmesan. Season and add plenty of nutmeg. Spoon out a couple of ladlefuls of the sauce and reserve for the top of the lasagne, then stir the chopped spinach and spring onions into the rest of the sauce.STEP 3Spread a third of the spinach sauce over the bottom of a large baking dish (or 8 individual dishes). Add a layer of pasta, then spread or brush over a third of the pesto. Top with another third of the spinach sauce, followed by pasta and pesto, then repeat the layers once more. Add a final layer of pasta, then spread over the reserved white sauce. Scatter with the pine nuts and remaining parmesan. Freeze now.STEP 4Heat the oven to 180C/ fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 40-45 minutes until bubbling, browned and crisp on top. Serve with watercress.
