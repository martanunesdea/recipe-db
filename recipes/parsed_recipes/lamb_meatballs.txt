Lamb meatballs
Ingredients
1 lb ground lamb
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 clove garlic, very finely chopped
2 tablespoons panko crumbs
1-1/2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves, finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, very finely chopped
2 cups diced tomatoes, undrained
1/2 to 1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground coriander
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Instructions
Combine the lamb, egg, garlic, panko, mint, parsley, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 16 to 18 meatballs about 1-1/4-inches in diameter.
Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook until lightly browned on all sides, about 3 minutes total. Transfer the meatballs to a plate, drain the excess fat from the pan and return it to the stove.
To make the sauce, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saut√© until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and continue cooking until fragrant, 1 minute longer.
Stir in the tomatoes. Add a 1/2 teaspoon each of cinnamon and coriander and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes, then taste again and adjust the spices as desired.
Return the meatballs to the pan and turn several times to coat them with the sauce. Cover and simmer slowly until the meatballs are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.
Transfer the meatballs and sauce to a serving dish, garnish with parsley and serve with steamed white rice.
