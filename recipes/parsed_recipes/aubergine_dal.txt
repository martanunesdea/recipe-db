Instructions
Boil a full kettle
Add your basmati rice and 300ml [390ml] [600ml] cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat
Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked
Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving
While the rice is cooking, peel and finely slice half your shallots, then peel and finely slice half your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)
Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)
Dissolve your vegetable stock mix and chopped creamed coconut in 600ml [800ml] [1L] boiled water – this is your coconut stock
Rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water
Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and discard, then slice lengthways, into strips
Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat
Once hot, add the aubergine strips with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 10-12 min, turning occasionally until golden and tender
Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!
Heat a separate pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat
Once hot, add the sliced shallot, sliced garlic, curry powder and half your ground turmeric (you’ll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min, then add the lentils and cook for 1 min further
Add the coconut stock, bring to the boil over a high heat, and cook for 15-20 min or until the lentils are tender and starting to break down – this is your Sri Lankan-style coconut dal
Whilst everything is cooking, slice your green chilli[es] in half lengthways, then slice diagonally into strips
Peel and chop the remaining shallot[s] into wedges
Peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic
Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger
Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)
Combine the chopped garlic with the chopped ginger, chopped coriander, cider vinegar, black mustard seeds and 1 tbsp [1 1/2 tbsp] [2 tbsp] sugar in a bowl – this is your pickling liquid
Once the aubergine is golden and tender, transfer it to kitchen paper and return the pan to a medium heat
Add the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and shallot wedges with the remaining ground turmeric and cook for 2-3 min
Return the cooked aubergine to the pan with the pickling liquid and cook for 2-3 min or until all the liquid has evaporated – this is your aubergine pickle
Serve the Sri Lankan-style coconut dal with the basmati rice to the side
Top with the aubergine pickle, garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and season with a grind of black pepper
Serves 2
